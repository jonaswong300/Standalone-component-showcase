# Angular14

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2.

## Description
This repo showcases a very high level view of standalone components made available in Angular V14. 
Standalone components provide a simplified way to build Angular applications. Standalone components, directives, and pipes aim to streamline the authoring experience by reducing the need for NgModules. Existing applications can optionally and incrementally adopt the new standalone style without any breaking changes.

Now Angular standalone components are components which can be used without declaring them in the NGModule. We simply have to specify `standalone: true` property inside our @component decorator. Thus reducing complexity of building and making development easier. 

Do refer to (https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components) for more information with regards to StandAlone components. 

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
